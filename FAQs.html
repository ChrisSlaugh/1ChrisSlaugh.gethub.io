                <li>What Age Range is Appropriate?
                </li>
                <p>All age ranges are appropriate, but children above the age of 8, are more likely to enjoy their experiance and are less likely to be stuck in the boat and board.</p>

                <li>Is White Water Rafting safe? I don't Even Know how to Swim. Can I still come?
                </li>
                <p>All white-water rafters must use a coast guard approved personal flotation device (PFD). Many non-swimmers come and go safely and having a good time.

                <li>What should I be Concerned About?</li>
                <p>The most common injury that occurs is sun-burns and injuries on land, plenty of sunscreen should protect against sun burns, and general safety should protect you on land
                    <li>What is So great about white water rafting anyway?</li>
                    <p>Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food.

                    </p>
                    <li>How far in Advance Should I book My Trip?</li>
                    <P>If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in advance. If you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is usually sufficient.
